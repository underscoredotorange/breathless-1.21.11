# BREATHLESS
Give the world a little more danger, a little less air... That's Breathless
Completely serverside and safe for crossplay!

## What this mod adds:
### Altitude Sickness
Above y=120, the air starts thinning. You start to feel the effects of *Hypoxia* unless your body has acclimated. 
Climbing tall mountains and flying is a little more dangerous.
Symptoms include but are not limited to:
> - Fatigue
> - Weakness
> - Exhaustion (slowness)

### Carbon Dioxide Poisoning
Below y=40, the air starts stagnating. You start to feel more and more sick as you descend the depths.
Mining ill-prepared is significantly more dangerous.
Symptoms include but are not limited to:
> - Fatigue
> - Weakness
> - Poisoning

### Water-breathing potions
Water-breathing potions now act as your oxygen tanks, aside from breathing underwater. Investing in potions early game is recommended!

## Development
Still in very early development. Will likely add more serverside configurations in the future. This was made for a personal school smp server.
